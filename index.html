        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Supernovae bombarded Earth with cosmic energy starting as many as 8 million years ago, with a peak some 2.6 million years ago. This cosmic event initiated an avalanche of electrons in the lower atmosphere, setting off a chain of events that possibly ended with bipedal hominins such as Homo habilis, dubbed "handy man." This phenomenon may have had a significant impact on the evolution of early human ancestors.</p>

        <h2>Cosmic Energy and Earth's Atmosphere</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Initiation of Electron Avalanche</h3>
            <p>The cosmic rays from supernovae bombarded the Earth, leading to an increase in atmospheric ionization. The ionization caused an avalanche of electrons in the lower atmosphere, a process typically not seen with normal cosmic rays.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Increased Lightning Strikes</h3>
            <p>The increased ionization likely triggered an enormous upsurge in cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. The abundance of free electrons provided more pathways for lightning, leading to more frequent and intense lightning storms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Impact on Global Climate</h3>
            <p>These lightning strikes could have ignited widespread forest fires, significantly altering the Earth's climate and vegetation. The transformation from dense forests to open savannas in northeast Africa provided new environmental pressures that may have influenced the evolutionary path of human ancestors.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact on Human Evolution</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Development of Bipedalism</h3>
            <p>The transition from forested areas to savannas meant early hominins had to adapt to new environments. Walking upright became advantageous for moving across open grasslands, spotting predators, and foraging for food. This shift in locomotion is believed to have played a critical role in the evolution of bipedalism.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Evidence from Iron-60 Deposits</h3>
            <p>Researchers have found a telltale layer of iron-60 deposits lining the world's seabeds. These deposits, formed during the Pliocene Epoch, indicate that supernovae exploded in Earth's immediate cosmic neighborhood, approximately 100 to 50 parsecs away. The presence of iron-60 supports the hypothesis of increased cosmic ray exposure during this period.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Global Wildfires and Evolution</h3>
            <p>Increased lightning activity likely led to global wildfires, as evidenced by charcoal and soot deposits found in soils from that era. These environmental changes are thought to have driven the evolution of hominins in northeast Africa, where the Great Rift Valley holds numerous hominin fossils.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While supernovae could have influenced the evolution of bipedalism in human ancestors, such events are not likely to recur in the near future. The nearest star capable of a supernova, Betelgeuse, is too far away to have similar effects. However, the impact of past cosmic events on Earth's environment and the evolution of life continues to be a fascinating area of research.</p>
